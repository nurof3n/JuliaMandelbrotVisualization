# JuliaMandelbrotVisualization
This is the project I've made for the Informatics class in last year of highschool, tweaked a little for making it public on github.
It was made in Visual Studio 2019.
Basically, it's an app that draws the Julia fractal with varying complex constant, in different color schemes. See the Images folder for screenshots captured inside the app.
